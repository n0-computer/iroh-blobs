//! Protocol for transferring content-addressed blobs over [`iroh`] p2p QUIC connections.
//!
//! # Participants
//!
//! The protocol is a request/response protocol with two parties, a *provider* that
//! serves blobs and a *getter* that requests blobs.
//!
//! # Goals
//!
//! - Be paranoid about data integrity.
//!
//!   Data integrity is considered more important than performance. Data will be validated both on
//!   the provider and getter side. A well behaved provider will never send invalid data. Responses
//!   to range requests contain sufficient information to validate the data.
//!
//!   Note: Validation using blake3 is extremely fast, so in almost all scenarios the validation
//!   will not be the bottleneck even if we validate both on the provider and getter side.
//!
//! - Do not limit the size of blobs or collections.
//!
//!   Blobs can be of arbitrary size, up to terabytes. Likewise, collections can contain an
//!   arbitrary number of links. A well behaved implementation will not require the entire blob or
//!   collection to be in memory at once.
//!
//! - Be efficient when transferring large blobs, including range requests.
//!
//!   It is possible to request entire blobs or ranges of blobs, where the minimum granularity is a
//!   chunk group of 16KiB or 16 blake3 chunks. The worst case overhead when doing range requests
//!   is about two chunk groups per range.
//!
//! - Be efficient when transferring multiple tiny blobs.
//!
//!   For tiny blobs the overhead of sending the blob hashes and the round-trip time for each blob
//!   would be prohibitive.
//!
//! To avoid roundtrips, the protocol allows grouping multiple blobs into *collections*.
//! The semantic meaning of a collection is up to the application. For the purpose
//! of this protocol, a collection is just a grouping of related blobs.
//!
//! # Non-goals
//!
//! - Do not attempt to be generic in terms of the used hash function.
//!
//!   The protocol makes extensive use of the [blake3](https://crates.io/crates/blake3) hash
//!   function and it's special properties such as blake3 verified streaming.
//!
//! - Do not support graph traversal.
//!
//!   The protocol only supports collections that directly contain blobs. If you have deeply nested
//!   graph data, you will need to either do multiple requests or flatten the graph into a single
//!   temporary collection.
//!
//! - Do not support discovery.
//!
//!   The protocol does not yet have a discovery mechanism for asking the provider what ranges are
//!   available for a given blob. Currently you have to have some out-of-band knowledge about what
//!   node has data for a given hash, or you can just try to retrieve the data and see if it is
//!   available.
//!
//! A discovery protocol is planned in the future though.
//!
//! # Requests
//!
//! ## Getter defined requests
//!
//! In this case the getter knows the hash of the blob it wants to retrieve and
//! whether it wants to retrieve a single blob or a collection.
//!
//! The getter needs to define exactly what it wants to retrieve and send the
//! request to the provider.
//!
//! The provider will then respond with the bao encoded bytes for the requested
//! data and then close the connection. It will immediately close the connection
//! in case some data is not available or invalid.
//!
//! ## Provider defined requests
//!
//! In this case the getter sends a blob to the provider. This blob can contain
//! some kind of query. The exact details of the query are up to the application.
//!
//! The provider evaluates the query and responds with a serialized request in
//! the same format as the getter defined requests, followed by the bao encoded
//! data. From then on the protocol is the same as for getter defined requests.
//!
//! ## Specifying the required data
//!
//! A [`GetRequest`] contains a hash and a specification of what data related to
//! that hash is required. The specification is using a [`ChunkRangesSeq`] which
//! has a compact representation on the wire but is otherwise identical to a
//! sequence of sets of ranges.
//!
//! In the following, we describe how the [`GetRequest`] is to be created for
//! different common scenarios.
//!
//! Under the hood, this is using the [`ChunkRangesSeq`] type, but the most
//! convenient way to create a [`GetRequest`] is to use the builder API.
//!
//! Ranges are always given in terms of 1024 byte blake3 chunks, *not* in terms
//! of bytes or chunk groups. The reason for this is that chunks are the fundamental
//! unit of hashing in BLAKE3. Addressing anything smaller than a chunk is not
//! possible, and combining multiple chunks is merely an optimization to reduce
//! metadata overhead.
//!
//! ### Individual blobs
//!
//! In the easiest case, the getter just wants to retrieve a single blob. In this
//! case, the getter specifies [`ChunkRangesSeq`] that contains a single element.
//! This element is the set of all chunks to indicate that we
//! want the entire blob, no matter how many chunks it has.
//!
//! Since this is a very common case, there is a convenience method
//! [`GetRequest::blob`] that only requires the hash of the blob.
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use iroh_blobs::protocol::GetRequest;
//! # let hash: iroh_blobs::Hash = [0; 32].into();
//! let request = GetRequest::blob(hash);
//! ```
//!
//! ### Ranges of blobs
//!
//! In this case, we have a (possibly large) blob and we want to retrieve only
//! some ranges of chunks. This is useful in similar cases as HTTP range requests.
//!
//! We still need just a single element in the [`ChunkRangesSeq`], since we are
//! still only interested in a single blob. However, this element contains all
//! the chunk ranges we want to retrieve.
//!
//! For example, if we want to retrieve chunks 0-10 of a blob, we would
//! create a [`ChunkRangesSeq`] like this:
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use iroh_blobs::protocol::{GetRequest, ChunkRanges, ChunkRangesExt};
//! # let hash: iroh_blobs::Hash = [0; 32].into();
//! let request = GetRequest::builder()
//!     .root(ChunkRanges::chunks(..10))
//!     .build(hash);
//! ```
//!
//! While not that common, it is also possible to request multiple ranges of a
//! single blob. For example, if we want to retrieve chunks `0-10` and `100-110`
//! of a large file, we would create a [`GetRequest`] like this:
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use iroh_blobs::protocol::{GetRequest, ChunkRanges, ChunkRangesExt, ChunkRangesSeq};
//! # let hash: iroh_blobs::Hash = [0; 32].into();
//! let request = GetRequest::builder()
//!     .root(ChunkRanges::chunks(..10) | ChunkRanges::chunks(100..110))
//!     .build(hash);
//! ```
//!
//! This is all great, but in most cases we are not interested in chunks but
//! in bytes. The [`ChunkRanges`] type has a constructor that allows providing
//! byte ranges instead of chunk ranges. These will be rounded up to the
//! nearest chunk.
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use iroh_blobs::protocol::{GetRequest, ChunkRanges, ChunkRangesExt, ChunkRangesSeq};
//! # let hash: iroh_blobs::Hash = [0; 32].into();
//! let request = GetRequest::builder()
//!     .root(ChunkRanges::bytes(..1000) | ChunkRanges::bytes(10000..11000))
//!     .build(hash);
//! ```
//!
//! There are also methods to request a single chunk or a single byte offset,
//! as well as a special constructor for the last chunk of a blob.
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use iroh_blobs::protocol::{GetRequest, ChunkRanges, ChunkRangesExt, ChunkRangesSeq};
//! # let hash: iroh_blobs::Hash = [0; 32].into();
//! let request = GetRequest::builder()
//!     .root(ChunkRanges::offset(1) | ChunkRanges::last_chunk())
//!     .build(hash);
//! ```
//!
//! To specify chunk ranges, we use the [`ChunkRanges`] type alias.
//! This is actually the [`RangeSet`] type from the
//! [range_collections](https://crates.io/crates/range_collections) crate. This
//! type supports efficient boolean operations on sets of non-overlapping ranges.
//!
//! The [`RangeSet2`] type is a type alias for [`RangeSet`] that can store up to
//! 2 boundaries without allocating. This is sufficient for most use cases.
//!
//! [`RangeSet`]: range_collections::range_set::RangeSet
//! [`RangeSet2`]: range_collections::range_set::RangeSet2
//!
//! ### Hash sequences
//!
//! In this case the provider has a hash sequence that refers multiple blobs.
//! We want to retrieve all blobs in the hash sequence.
//!
//! When used for hash sequences, the first element of a [`ChunkRangesSeq`] refers
//! to the hash seq itself, and all subsequent elements refer to the blobs
//! in the hash seq. When a [`ChunkRangesSeq`] specifies ranges for more than
//! one blob, the provider will interpret this as a request for a hash seq.
//!
//! One thing to note is that we might not yet know how many blobs are in the
//! hash sequence. Therefore, it is not possible to download an entire hash seq
//! by just specifying [`ChunkRanges::all()`] for all children.
//!
//! Instead, [`ChunkRangesSeq`] allows defining infinite sequences of range sets.
//! The [`ChunkRangesSeq::all()`] method returns a [`ChunkRangesSeq`] that, when iterated
//! over, will yield [`ChunkRanges::all()`] forever.
//!
//! So a get request to download a hash sequence blob and all its children
//! would look like this:
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use iroh_blobs::protocol::{ChunkRanges, ChunkRangesExt, GetRequest};
//! # let hash: iroh_blobs::Hash = [0; 32].into();
//! let request = GetRequest::builder()
//!     .root(ChunkRanges::all())
//!     .build_open(hash); // repeats the last range forever
//! ```
//!
//! Downloading an entire hash seq is also a very common case, so there is a
//! convenience method [`GetRequest::all`] that only requires the hash of the
//! hash sequence blob.
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use iroh_blobs::protocol::{ChunkRanges, ChunkRangesExt, GetRequest};
//! # let hash: iroh_blobs::Hash = [0; 32].into();
//! let request = GetRequest::all(hash);
//! ```
//!
//! ### Parts of hash sequences
//!
//! The most complex common case is when we have retrieved a hash seq and
//! it's children, but were interrupted before we could retrieve all children.
//!
//! In this case we need to specify the hash seq we want to retrieve, but
//! exclude the children and parts of children that we already have.
//!
//! For example, if we have a hash with 3 children, and we already have
//! the first child and the first 1000000 chunks of the second child.
//!
//! We would create a [`GetRequest`] like this:
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use iroh_blobs::protocol::{GetRequest, ChunkRanges, ChunkRangesExt};
//! # let hash: iroh_blobs::Hash = [0; 32].into();
//! let request = GetRequest::builder()
//!     .child(1, ChunkRanges::chunks(1000000..)) // we don't need the first child;
//!     .next(ChunkRanges::all()) // we need the second child and all subsequent children completely
//!     .build_open(hash);
//! ```
//!
//! ### Requesting chunks for each child
//!
//! The ChunkRangesSeq allows some scenarios that are not covered above. E.g. you
//! might want to request a hash seq and the first chunk of each child blob to
//! do something like mime type detection.
//!
//! You do not know how many children the collection has, so you need to use
//! an infinite sequence.
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use iroh_blobs::protocol::{GetRequest, ChunkRanges, ChunkRangesExt, ChunkRangesSeq};
//! # let hash: iroh_blobs::Hash = [0; 32].into();
//! let request = GetRequest::builder()
//!     .root(ChunkRanges::all())
//!     .next(ChunkRanges::chunk(1)) // the first chunk of each child)
//!     .build_open(hash);
//! ```
//!
//! ### Requesting a single child
//!
//! It is of course possible to request a single child of a collection. E.g.
//! the following would download the second child of a collection:
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use iroh_blobs::protocol::{GetRequest, ChunkRanges, ChunkRangesExt};
//! # let hash: iroh_blobs::Hash = [0; 32].into();
//! let request = GetRequest::builder()
//!     .child(1, ChunkRanges::all()) // we need the second child completely
//!     .build(hash);
//! ```
//!
//! However, if you already have the collection, you might as well locally
//! look up the hash of the child and request it directly.
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use iroh_blobs::protocol::{GetRequest, ChunkRanges, ChunkRangesSeq};
//! # let child_hash: iroh_blobs::Hash = [0; 32].into();
//! let request = GetRequest::blob(child_hash);
//! ```
//!
//! ### Why ChunkRanges and ChunkRangesSeq?
//!
//! You might wonder why we have [`ChunkRangesSeq`], when a simple
//! sequence of [`ChunkRanges`] might also do.
//!
//! The [`ChunkRangesSeq`] type exist to provide an efficient
//! representation of the request on the wire. In the wire encoding of [`ChunkRangesSeq`],
//! [`ChunkRanges`] are encoded alternating intervals of selected and non-selected chunks.
//! This results in smaller numbers that will result in fewer bytes on the wire when using
//! the [postcard](https://crates.io/crates/postcard) encoding format that uses variable
//! length integers.
//!
//! Likewise, the [`ChunkRangesSeq`] type
//! does run length encoding to remove repeating elements. It also allows infinite
//! sequences of [`ChunkRanges`] to be encoded, unlike a simple sequence of
//! [`ChunkRanges`]s.
//!
//! [`ChunkRangesSeq`] should be efficient even in case of very fragmented availability
//! of chunks, like a download from multiple providers that was frequently interrupted.
//!
//! # Responses
//!
//! The response stream contains the bao encoded bytes for the requested data.
//! The data will be sent in the order in which it was requested, so ascending
//! chunks for each blob, and blobs in the order in which they appear in the
//! hash seq.
//!
//! For details on the bao encoding, see the [bao specification](https://github.com/oconnor663/bao/blob/master/docs/spec.md)
//! and the [bao-tree](https://crates.io/crates/bao-tree) crate. The bao-tree crate
//! is identical to the bao crate, except that it allows combining multiple BLAKE3
//! chunks to chunk groups for efficiency.
//!
//! For a complete response, the chunks are guaranteed to completely cover the
//! requested ranges.
//!
//! Reasons for not retrieving a complete response are two-fold:
//!
//! - the connection to the provider was interrupted, or the provider encountered
//!   an internal error. In this case the provider will close the entire quinn connection.
//!
//! - the provider does not have the requested data, or discovered on send that the
//!   requested data is not valid.
//!
//! In this case the provider will close just the stream used to send the response.
//! The exact location of the missing data can be retrieved from the error.
//!
//! # Requesting multiple unrelated blobs
//!
//! Let's say you don't have a hash sequence on the provider side, but you
//! nevertheless want to request multiple unrelated blobs in a single request.
//!
//! For this, there is the [`GetManyRequest`] type, which also comes with a
//! builder API.
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use iroh_blobs::protocol::{GetManyRequest, ChunkRanges, ChunkRangesExt};
//! # let hash1: iroh_blobs::Hash = [0; 32].into();
//! # let hash2: iroh_blobs::Hash = [1; 32].into();
//! GetManyRequest::builder()
//!     .hash(hash1, ChunkRanges::all())
//!     .hash(hash2, ChunkRanges::all())
//!     .build();
//! ```
//! If you accidentally or intentionally request ranges for the same hash
//! multiple times, they will be merged into a single [`ChunkRanges`].
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use iroh_blobs::protocol::{GetManyRequest, ChunkRanges, ChunkRangesExt};
//! # let hash1: iroh_blobs::Hash = [0; 32].into();
//! # let hash2: iroh_blobs::Hash = [1; 32].into();
//! GetManyRequest::builder()
//!     .hash(hash1, ChunkRanges::chunk(1))
//!     .hash(hash2, ChunkRanges::all())
//!     .hash(hash1, ChunkRanges::last_chunk())
//!     .build();
//! ```
//!
//! This is mostly useful for requesting multiple tiny blobs in a single request.
//! For large or even medium sized blobs, multiple requests are not expensive.
//! Multiple requests just create multiple streams on the same connection,
//! which is *very* cheap in QUIC.
//!
//! In case nodes are permanently exchanging data, it is somewhat valuable to
//! keep a connection open and reuse it for multiple requests. However, creating
//! a new connection is also very cheap, so you would only do this to optimize
//! a large existing system that has demonstrated performance issues.
//!
//! If in doubt, just use multiple requests and multiple connections.
