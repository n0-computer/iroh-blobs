//! # Module docs
//!
//! The crate is designed to be used from the [iroh] crate.
//!
//! It implements a [protocol] for streaming content-addressed data transfer using
//! [BLAKE3] verified streaming.
//!
//! It also provides a [store] module for storage of blobs and outboards,
//! as well as a [persistent](crate::store::fs) and a [memory](crate::store::mem)
//! store implementation.
//!
//! To implement a server, the [provider] module provides helpers for handling
//! connections and individual requests given a store.
//!
//! To perform get requests, the [get] module provides utilities to perform
//! requests and store the result in a store, as well as a low level state
//! machine for executing requests.
//!
//! The client API is available in the [api] module. You can get a client
//! either from one of the [store] implementations, or from the [BlobsProtocol]
//! via a
//!
//! The [downloader](api::downloader) module provides a component to download blobs from
//! multiple sources and store them in a store.
