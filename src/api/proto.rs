#![cfg_attr(feature = "hide-proto-docs", doc(hidden))]
//! The protocol that a store implementation needs to implement.
//!
//! A store needs to handle [`Request`]s. It is fine to just return an error for some
//! commands. E.g. an immutable store can just return an error for import commands.
//!
//! Each command consists of a serializable request message and channels for updates
//! and responses. The enum containing the full requests is [`Command`]. These are the
//! commands you will have to handle in a store actor handler.
//!
//! This crate provides a file system based store implementation, [`crate::store::fs::FsStore`],
//! as well as a mutable in-memory store and an immutable in-memory store.
//!
//! The file system store is quite complex and optimized, so to get started take a look at
//! the much simpler memory store.
